# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 29th, 2019 - Tuesday


**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML5. Specifically working on advanced text formatting, images, lists, tables, and advanced images formatting. Working through "A complete introductory tutorial on HTML5" found for free on Udemy. 

**Thoughts:** Honestly really enjoying it so far. Im having a harder time understanding github than I am HTML5.

**Link to work:** Im not sure how to link to my work yet. I will figure this out soon. 


### Day 2: October 30th, 2019 - Wednesday


**Today's Progress**: Today I took a break from my HTML course to figure out how to use Github as well as share my code. What youre reading here is the outcome of that work.

**Thoughts**: I think its a little confusing, but I also think that with time I can master it.
